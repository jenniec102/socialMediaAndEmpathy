        <p>In today's digital world, people are able to access loads of information. People can find out about what is happening on the other side of the world and can keep updated on what their loved ones or celebrities are doing. Likewise, they can also share their thoughts and put up updates of their own life. In this age of exposure and loss of privacy, it is important to note that there is also a decline in empathy of newer generations.</p>

        <div class="fact">
          <h3>University of Michigan researchers analyzed results from 72 studies on American college students from 1979 to 2009 and found a small, but significant decrease in empathy in youths.</h3>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>In a study done on older adolescents and young adults in college, there has been a noted decrease in empathy. Young people today may be more accepting of others with cultural, physical, or sexual differences, but there is no call to understand others. Approaches to people who are different are shallow and the result is that people still prefer to be with people who are like them. While this seems natural and inevitable, shallow approaches to others restricts possibilities of more connections between people. (Gardner and Davis, 110)</p>
        <br>
        <h3>People today are more socially conscious in that we accept more differences. However, people still do not readily put themselves in others' shoes</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Too much of anything is of course detrimental and the same goes for empathy. Too much empathy can become too burdensome, to the point of burnout and depression, especially in the case where an occupation may require seeing difficult and emotionally taxing scenes daily. However, maintaining a decent level of empathy allows for more benefits to a person and the people around them. </p>
