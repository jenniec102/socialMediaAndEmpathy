        <p>In today's digital world, people are able to access loads of information. People can find out about what is happening on the other side of the world and can keep updated on what their loved ones or celebrities are doing. Likewise, they can also share their thoughts and put up updates of their own life. In this age of exposure and loss of privacy, it is important to note that there is also a decline in empathy of newer generations.</p>

        <p>In a study done on older adolescents and young adults in college, there has been a noted decrease in empathy. Young people today may be more accepting of others with cultural, physical, or sexual differences, but there is no call to understand others. Approaches to people who are different are shallow and the result is that people still prefer to be with people who are like them. While this seems natural and inevitable, shallow approaches to others restricts possibilities of more connections between people. This attitude ultimately affects people's actions and willingness to help others. (Gardner and Davis, 110) </p>

        <p>Too much of anything is of course detrimental and the same goes for empathy. Too much empathy can become too burdensome, to the point of burnout and depression, especially in the case where an occupation may require seeing difficult and emotionally taxing scenes daily. However, maintaining a decent level of empathy allows for more benefits to a person and the people around them. </p>

        <br>
        <!-- obstructing empathy -->
        <p>Feelings of otherness stop us from attempting to empathize. When someone is percieved to be "different", it's easy to disregard their perspectives and feelings. Instead, we assume that we can never know what they think and that they have nothing to do with "us". Social media can hinder our ability to empathize by exacerbating our differences. Social media can polarize and keep people in echo chambers where there is less exposure to different people. In addition, practicing empathy requires people to read facial expressions and body language - both things that social media is unable to properly convey. Without the need to empathize, the empathy skill becomes dull over time. </p>

        <!-- fostering empathy -->
        <p>Social media can block empathy, but is also capable of fostering it. Images, videos, and stories that people share online can illicit empathy in others. When not in an echo chamber, exposure to different kinds of people is easy, especially if you actively allow yourself to come across new people and stories. Social media helps increase exposure to social issues, but without the motivation to do more, it can end with just exposure. It's not a bad start, but that should not be the minimum. </p>

        <h2>The way we use social media can affect our ability to empathize with others. In a time where social media is ever present in our lives, we need to be mindful about how we navigate social media and how we teach new generations to navigate it.</h2>
