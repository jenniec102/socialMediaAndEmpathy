      <div class="content">
        <p>Self-empathy is an important step to empathize with others. This is not the same as self-pity or self-worship. Self-empathy means to give yourself the same understanding and compassion that you extend to others. By recognizing that oneself has faults as a human being, but still deserves kindness and concern, one can increase their self-awareness and empathize with others better. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Since empathy is a skill that can be developed, there are actions that people can take to build their empathy. Practicing empathy can help relieve one's own frustrations, as well as others.</p>

        <h3>Active Listening</h3>

          <p>Try to actively listen when someone is speaking to you. While it can be difficult at times, the goal is to understand what the other person is saying rather than preparing to say something back immediately. It can help to catch yourself from cutting others off and also look at their body language and expressions to gauge how they feel. Avoid distractions like the phone during this time. </p>

          <p>Take a few moments to observe others' actions and emotions. Try looking at things from their perspective to understand why they do what they say and why they feel a certain way. Would you feel the same way in their situation? Are there things that you may not have considered that affect their perspective?</p>
