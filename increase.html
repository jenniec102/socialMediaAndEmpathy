      <div class="content">
        <p>Self-empathy is an important step to empathize with others. This is not the same as self-pity or self-worship. Self-empathy means to give yourself the same understanding and compassion that you extend to others. By recognizing that oneself has faults as a human being, but still deserves kindness and concern, one can increase their self-awareness and empathize with others better. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Since empathy is a skill that can be developed, there are actions that people can take to build their empathy. Practicing empathy can help relieve one's own frustrations, as well as others.</p>

        <h3>Active Listening</h3>
        <div class="row">

          <p>Try to actively listen when someone is speaking to you. While it can be difficult at times, the goal is to understand what the other person is saying rather than preparing to say something back immediately. It can help to catch yourself from cutting others off and also look at their body language and expressions to gauge how they feel. Avoid distractions like the phone during this time. </p>

          <p>Take a few moments to observe others' actions and emotions. Try looking at things from their perspective to understand why they do what they say and why they feel a certain way. Would you feel the same way in their situation? Are there things that you may not have considered that affect their perspective?</p>

        <h3>Be Open to Emotions</h3>

          <p>In order to empathize with someone and feel what they feel, you need to be willing to feel different emotions. This can range from happy feelings to more difficult feelings to experience. This applies to self-empathizing, as well. Remember that it can be taxing to empathize too much with emotionally draining emotions so do so moderately. </p>

        <h3>Practice Face-to-Face Communication</h3>
        <div class="row">

          <p>Communicating with people face-to-face is a good way to practice empathy. During conversations, you can get used to different body language and facial expressions and associate them with the corresponding emotions. While this seems like a natural skill that people should have, it can be improved upon to better respond to people depending on how they are feeling. </p>

          <p>Exposure to different activites and cultures can help widen your knowledge and in turn your perspective on things. By learning and experiencing different things, you can more easily put yourself in others' shoes. Empathizing becomes possible when you have experienced enough to relate to another person. </p>

        <h3>Read Fiction or Non-Fiction</h3>

          <img src="https://hustlersdigest.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/benefits-of-reading-books.jpg" alt="A man reading a book.">
          <p>Researchers at the New School found that reading fiction is correlated to having a greater capacity for empathy. This is thought to be the case because reading fiction requires the reader to view a character's perspective, feelings, and thoughts. This is another way to practice empathy. Although not part of the study, reading non-fiction books that immerse the reader in another's perspective can also help as practice. </p>
